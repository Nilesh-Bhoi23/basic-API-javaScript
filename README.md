<h1>JavaScript APIs</h1>
<br>
JavaScript APIs for WebExtensions can be used inside the extension's background scripts and in any other documents bundled with the extension,
<br>
including browser action or page action popups, sidebars, options pages, or new tab pages.
A few of these APIs can also be accessed by an extension's content scripts. (See the list in the content script guide.)
